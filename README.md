## Project Summary
Robot arms aren't necessarily cheap, especially with human-controlled aspects. To make the model cost-effective and easy-to-build, it could feature a 3D-printed structure and Servo motors, which will be presented through this project. The 3D-printed base is lightweight, as are the Servos, and the motors are very precise. This arm is designed for quick assembly and intuitive control. It is controlled via a joystick, contributing to the responsive aspect of the prototype. It is designed for simplicity, affordability, and versatility, making it ideal for anyone exploring robotics and software.
## Project Capabilities and Goals
- Produce a low cost robotic arm using a 3D printed structure and S51 Micro Servos
- Use 3-4 Servo motors to create a controllable arm
- Use a joystick to have control over base, and vertical movement of the arm
- Use an additional Servo Motor to control claw movement
## Materials Used
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Servo Motors (4)
- Joystick
- Jumper Wires
